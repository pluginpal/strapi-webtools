# GraphQL API

## Overview

As of writing this page there is no GraphQL API exposed by the Webtools core plugin. You might be able to still get most of its functionality by querying the native Strapi GraphQL API, but this is not officially supported at this time.

## Status

GraphQL support for Webtools core is not available yet. If you want this feature to happen, please get involved on GitHub. Webtools is a rapidly growing plugin suite for Strapi and community feedback is always appreciated.
