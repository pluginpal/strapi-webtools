# Website URL

The website URL config is a handy tool that can be used to add a `copy permalink` button to the sidebar of the edit view. When Webtools knows what the absolute URL of your website is, we can combine that with the URL alias to get you your permalinks.

:::note
This setting is part of the core Webtools configuration and is not the same as the Sitemap addon "Hostname" setting. For Sitemap hostname, see [Hostname](/webtools/addons/sitemap/settings/hostname).
