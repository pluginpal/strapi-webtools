# 🔧 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when working with Strapi Webtools.

## Installation Issues

### Node.js version error
```
The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=18"
```

**Solution:** Update Node.js to version 18 or higher:
```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Peer dependency warnings
Multiple warnings about unmet peer dependencies during installation.

**Solution:** These warnings are normal and won't affect functionality. The plugin will work correctly despite these warnings.

## License Issues

### License key activation is not valid
```
error: [webtools]: License key activation is not valid. Remove the activation_id from your package.json to issue a new activation for this project.
```

This error occurs when the stored license activation is no longer valid. This can happen when:

- You moved the project to a different machine
- You reinstalled dependencies or changed the project structure
- Your license has expired or been deactivated
- You've reached the maximum number of activations for your license

**Solution:** Remove the activation ID and restart Strapi to trigger a new activation:

1. Open your `package.json` file
2. Look for a field named `activation_id` (usually near the top level)
3. Remove the entire `activation_id` field and its value
4. Save the file
5. Restart your Strapi server

The plugin will automatically create a new activation on the next startup.

**Example:**

Before:
```json
{
  "name": "my-strapi-project",
  "activation_id": "abc123...",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  ...
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "name": "my-strapi-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  ...
}
```

:::tip
If you continue to experience activation issues after removing the `activation_id`, ensure your license key is correctly set in the `.env` file:
```
WEBTOOLS_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here
```

You can also re-run the license setup:
```bash
npx webtools-cli setup-license
```

## Pattern & URL Issues

### URL is incorrect
The Webtools plugin applies it's own slugify function to your URLs. That means that if you have already have a slugified field, which you then use in an URL pattern, it will be slugified again, potentially causing incorrect URLs. If you want you can disable the slugify function of Webtools by updating the slugify configuration.

See [slugify configuration docs](/configuration/slugify)

### Can't select field in pattern
When creating URL patterns, some content types don't show field options.

**Possible causes:**
- Content type has internationalization enabled
- Content type has no suitable fields for URL generation
- Browser cache issue - try hard refresh (Ctrl+R)

### Locale required
Some content types require locale selection when creating patterns.

**Explanation:** Multi-language content types need locale-specific patterns. This is normal behavior for internationalized content.

### Multiple content type bundles
Content types can be selected multiple times in sitemap bundles.

**Use case:** Each bundle can have different settings (change frequency, priority, locale-specific configurations).

## Sitemap Issues

### Invalid URL error (500)
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]: Invalid URL
```

**Solution:** Ensure hostname includes protocol prefix:
- ✅ Correct: `http://localhost:1337`
- ❌ Wrong: `localhost:1337`

### Generate sitemap button stuck
UI becomes unresponsive after sitemap generation error (usually caused by incorrect hostname format).

**Solution:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+R) to reset the interface state.

### Router permissions error
500 error when generating sitemap, even with correct URL format.

**Solution:** Enable router permissions in **Settings > Users & Permissions > Public**:
- `webtools.router.find`

## API Issues

### Returns all URLs instead of one
```bash
curl "localhost:1337/api/webtools/url-alias?url_path=/my-path"
# Returns all URLs, not just the requested one
```

**Solution:** Use Strapi's filter syntax:
```bash
curl "localhost:1337/api/webtools/url-alias?filters[url_path][$eq]=/my-path"
```

### 403 forbidden error
```json
{"error": {"status": 403, "name": "ForbiddenError"}}
```

**Solution:** Enable webtools permissions in **Settings > Users & Permissions > Public**:
- `webtools.url-alias.find`
- `webtools.router.find`

### CORS Errors in Development
```
Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
```

**Solution:** Add development origins to `config/middlewares.ts`:
```js
{
  name: 'strapi::cors',
  config: {
    origin: [
      'http://localhost:3000',
      'file://',
      'null'
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration Issues

### Default Language URL Type
Controls how the default locale appears in URLs:

- **Disabled**: All URLs use same format `/path`
- **Default language URL of bundles**: Default locale gets `/en/path`, others `/nl/path`
- **Other**: Custom locale handling

Choose based on your multilingual URL structure needs.

### URL Bundle Configuration
Each content type can have multiple bundles with different:
- Change frequency (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Priority settings (0.1 - 1.0)
- Locale-specific configurations

This allows fine-grained control over how different content appears in your sitemap.

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check server logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Restart Strapi** after configuration changes
3. **Clear browser cache** if UI behaves unexpectedly
4. **Verify permissions** are correctly set for all required endpoints

If problems persist, check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pluginpal/strapi-webtools/issues) or create a new issue with your configuration details.
