### Installation

After you've setup your license you can install the addon like so:

<Tabs groupId="yarn-npm">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```
    yarn add @pluginpal/webtools-addon-links
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```
    npm install @pluginpal/webtools-addon-links --save
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After successful installation you have to rebuild the admin UI so it'll include this plugin. To rebuild and restart Strapi run:

<Tabs groupId="yarn-npm">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```
    yarn build
    yarn develop
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```
    npm run build
    npm run develop
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
