# Hostname (required)

The hostname is the URL of your website. It will be used as the base URL of all URLs added to the sitemap XML. It is required to generate the XML file.

:::note
This setting belongs to the Sitemap addon and is not the same as the core Webtools "Website URL" configuration used for permalinks. For the core setting, see [Website URL](/webtools/configuration/website-url).
