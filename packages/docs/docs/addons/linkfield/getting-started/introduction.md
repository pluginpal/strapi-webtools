# Webtools Linkfield Add-on

The **Linkfield add-on** for Webtools Pro provides a powerful custom field type that allows content creators to easily create internal links within their Strapi CMS content. This field type streamlines the process of linking to other content entries, pages, or sections within your application.

## What is Linkfield?

Linkfield is a custom field component that integrates seamlessly with your Strapi content types, providing an intuitive interface for selecting and managing internal links. Instead of manually typing URLs or remembering content IDs, users can search and select content through a user-friendly modal interface.

## Key Features

- **🔗 Internal Link Management** - Easy selection of internal content for linking
- **🔍 Smart Search** - Find content quickly with built-in search functionality
- **📝 Content Type Support** - Works with all your custom content types
- **🌐 Multi-language Support** - Full support for internationalized content
- **⚡ Real-time Validation** - Instant validation of link targets
- **🎨 Intuitive UI** - Clean, user-friendly interface integrated with Strapi's design system

## How it Works

The Linkfield add-on adds a new field type to your Strapi content type builder. When content creators use this field, they can:

1. Click on the field to open a link picker modal
2. Browse or search through available content entries
3. Select the desired target content
4. The field automatically stores the reference and displays the linked content title

## Use Cases

- **Blog Posts** - Link to related articles or author pages
- **Product Pages** - Connect products to categories or related items
