# üí° Usage
With this plugin you have full control over which redirects should be active for your front-end. You can create, update and delete redirects right from the Strapi admin panel.

## Overview

On the redirects overview you can see all the redirects on your site.

## Create redirects

With the button in the top right you can create new redirects.

### URL Format

When creating redirects, follow these guidelines for the URL paths:

**From Path (Source URL):**
- Always start with a forward slash `/`
- Use relative paths only (no domain)
- Example: `/old-page` or `/blog/old-article`

**To Path (Destination URL):**
- For internal redirects: use relative paths starting with `/`
  - Example: `/new-page` or `/blog/new-article`
- For external redirects: use the full URL including protocol
  - Example: `https://example.com/page`

**Examples:**

| From Path | To Path | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `/old-page` | `/new-page` | Internal redirect |
| `/blog/article` | `/news/article` | Internal redirect to different section |
| `/external` | `https://example.com` | External redirect |

### Status Codes

Choose the appropriate HTTP status code for your redirect:

| Status Code | Name | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------|
| **301** | Permanent Redirect | The resource has been permanently moved to a new location. Search engines will transfer the SEO value to the new URL. | Use when a page has permanently moved and you want to preserve SEO rankings. |
| **302** | Temporary Redirect | The resource is temporarily at a different location. Search engines keep the original URL indexed. | Use for temporary changes, A/B testing, or maintenance pages. |
| **303** | See Other | The response to the request can be found at another URL using a GET request. | Use after POST/PUT requests to redirect to a confirmation page. |
| **307** | Temporary Redirect (Preserve Method) | Like 302, but guarantees the request method won't change. | Use when you need to preserve POST/PUT methods in the redirect. |
| **308** | Permanent Redirect (Preserve Method) | Like 301, but guarantees the request method won't change. | Use for permanent redirects where the request method must be preserved. |

:::tip Choosing the Right Status Code
- **Most common:** Use **301** for permanent redirects and **302** for temporary ones
- **SEO impact:** 301 redirects transfer ~90-99% of link equity to the new URL
- **Caching:** 301 redirects are cached by browsers, 302 redirects are not
:::

:::caution
Be careful with 301 redirects as they are heavily cached by browsers. If you need to change a 301 redirect, users may not see the change immediately due to browser caching.

## Redirect Chains and Loops

The Webtools Redirects addon includes built-in protection against redirect chains and loops, which can harm user experience and SEO.

### What is a Redirect Chain?

A **redirect chain** occurs when multiple redirects are needed to reach the final destination. This creates an inefficient path that slows down page loads.

**Example of a chain:**
```
/page-a  ‚Üí  /page-b  ‚Üí  /page-c  (final destination)
```

When a user visits `/page-a`, they are first redirected to `/page-b`, then redirected again to `/page-c`. This requires two HTTP requests instead of one.

**Why chains are problematic:**
- **Slower page loads**: Each redirect adds network latency
- **SEO penalties**: Search engines may not follow long chains and could lose link equity
- **User experience**: Visitors experience longer wait times
- **Server load**: More requests mean more server resources

**Best practice:** Always redirect directly to the final destination:
```
/page-a  ‚Üí  /page-c
/page-b  ‚Üí  /page-c
```

### What is a Redirect Loop?

A **redirect loop** occurs when redirects create a circular reference with no final destination.

**Example of a loop:**
```
/page-a  ‚Üí  /page-b  ‚Üí  /page-a  (back to start)
```

This creates an infinite loop where the browser keeps redirecting between pages until it gives up and shows an error.

**Why loops are critical:**
- **Broken website**: The page becomes completely inaccessible
- **Browser errors**: Users see "Too many redirects" or "Redirect loop detected"
- **SEO disaster**: Search engines cannot index the page

### Chain and Loop Detection

The addon automatically validates redirects and **prevents you from creating chains or loops**. If you try to create a redirect that would result in a chain or loop, you'll see an error:

```
Creating this redirect would create a chain, please change it.
```

**Common scenarios that trigger this error:**

1. **Existing redirect path:** You try to create a redirect where the "To" path is already the "From" path of another redirect

   ```
   Existing: /old-page  ‚Üí  /new-page
   Attempt:  /campaign  ‚Üí  /old-page  ‚ùå (would create chain)
   ```

2. **Reverse redirect:** You try to create a redirect that reverses an existing one

   ```
   Existing: /page-a  ‚Üí  /page-b
   Attempt:  /page-b  ‚Üí  /page-a  ‚ùå (would create loop)
   ```

3. **URL alias conflict:** You change a URL alias to a path that's involved in an existing redirect

   ```
   Existing redirect: /google  ‚Üí  /google5
   Changing URL alias from /google5 to /google  ‚ùå (would create conflict)
   ```

### How to Fix Chain/Loop Errors

**If you encounter this error:**

1. **Check existing redirects**: Review your redirect list for conflicts
2. **Update existing redirects**: Instead of creating a new redirect, update the existing one to point directly to the final destination
3. **Delete conflicting redirects**: Remove the redirect that's causing the chain, then create a new direct redirect
4. **Plan URL changes carefully**: Before changing URL aliases, check if redirects exist for those paths

**Example fix:**

```
Problem:
  - Existing redirect: /old  ‚Üí  /current
  - You want to change URL from /current to /new
  - This would create: /old ‚Üí /current ‚Üí /new ‚ùå

Solution:
  1. Update the existing redirect to: /old  ‚Üí  /new
  2. Then change the URL alias to /new
  3. Auto-generate creates: /current  ‚Üí  /new
  4. Result: /old ‚Üí /new and /current ‚Üí /new ‚úì
```

## Access
After you've followed the steps above you can now access your redirects through the REST API of Strapi. It will be available at:

http://localhost:1337/api/webtools/redirects.

:::caution
You need to setup permissions for this endpoint to be accessible. See the [REST API documentation](/webtools/addons/redirects/api/rest#permissions) for details.
