## Next.js example implementation

For the redirects to take effect you need to configure them in your front-end. For example Next.js offers te ability configure redirects in the `next.config.js`.

You could fetch your redirects like this:

```ts
const redirects = () => {
  return fetch('http://localhost:1337/api/webtools/redirects')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(response => {
      // Use redirects however you need to
    });
};

module.exports = redirects;
```

And include them in the  `next.config.js` like this:

```ts
const getRedirects = require('./redirects');

module.exports = {
  // Other configurations...
  redirects: () => getRedirects(),
};
```
