# Auto generate

This plugin cleverly integrates with the core Webtools plugin. By doing so it is able to automatically create a redirect whenever one of your URL changes. It will create a redirect from the old URL to the new, and thus preventing the old URL from becoming a dead link anywhere it's been used.
