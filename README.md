## 🖐 Requirements

Complete installation requirements are the exact same as for Strapi itself and can be found in the [Strapi documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation).

**Supported Strapi versions**:

- Strapi 4.3.2 (recently tested)
- Strapi ^4.x

(This plugin may work with older Strapi versions, but these are not tested nor officially supported at this time.)

**We recommend always using the latest version of Strapi to start your new projects**.

## 💡 Usage
This plugin extends the Strapi edit view to add a 'URL alias' sidebar. In the sidebar you are able to add a URL alias for your page.

You can either overwrite the URL, or have it be generated based on a URL pattern.

## 🔌 URL pattern
To create dynamic URLs this plugin uses **URL patterns**. The URL pattern will be used to generate unique URLs based on the data available.

You can add URL patterns in the settings section of the plugin.

```
/pages/[my-title-field]
```

Fields can be injected in the pattern by escaping them with `[]`.

The following field types are allowed in a pattern:

- `id`
- `uid`
- `string`

## 📺  Endpoint

The plugin also comes with an endpoint you can use to find _any_ content by path.

#### REST

```js
await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/webtools/router?path=/about-page`);
// GET /api/webtools/router?path=/about-page
```

## ✨ #StrapiPluginWeek

This plugin was initially made as an entry to the <a href="https://lu.ma/strapihacks">Strapi Plugin Week</a> hackathon. Back then it went under the name "URL alias". Since then a lot has changed and the plugin has been renamed to Webtools where the URL alias feature is just a part of it.

See the <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/5409b9415e3e4b66ad27eab967c393d0">demo video</a>.
